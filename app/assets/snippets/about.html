    Each year, 2.7 million adoptable dogs and cats are euthanized in the United
    States, simply because too many pets come into shelters and too few people
    consider adoption when looking for a pet. The number of euthanized animals
    could be reduced dramatically if more people adopted pets instead of buying
    them. By supporting pet adoption and our lifesaving efforts, you can put
    your love into action, too. Together, let's create a better world for pets
